When you are working with a robot that has many relevant frames, it becomes 
quite a task to publish them all to tf. The robot state publisher is a tool 
that will do this job for you.

Imagine large bot with multiple moving peices like arms.

robot state publisher helps you to broadcast the state of your robot to the tf
transform library. The robot state publisher internally has a kinematic model 
of the robot; so given the joint positions of the robot, the robot state 
publisher can compute and broadcast the 3D pose of each link in the robot.

Easiest to run as a node, needs two things to run. URDF XML file on Param 
server and a source that publishes joint positions as a 
sensor_msgs/JointState.

Once you have setup the XML robot description and a source for joint position 
information, simply create a launch file like below.

 <launch>
   <!-- Load the urdf into the parameter server. -->
   <param name="my_robot_description" textfile="$(find mypackage)/urdf/robotmodel.xml"/>
    
   <node pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher" name="rob_st_pub" >
      <remap from="robot_description" to="my_robot_description" />
      <remap from="joint_states" to="different_joint_states" />
    </node>
  </launch>
