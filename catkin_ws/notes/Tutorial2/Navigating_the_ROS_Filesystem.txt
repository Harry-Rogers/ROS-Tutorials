sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials

Packages: Software organisation unit of ROS code. Each package has libraries,
exe, scripts or other artifacts.

Manifests: Description of package defines dependencies between packages and to
capture meta information about package like version, maintainer liscence etc.

rospack can find packages instead of using ls and cd to find them. 
Find does not work so rospack is only option.

roscd will goto package so roscd rospy will go to rospy dir and will go 
deep if needed ie roscd roscpp/cmake. 
roscd log will find stored ros files if none ran before will print error.

rosls will ls into dir will also go deep.
