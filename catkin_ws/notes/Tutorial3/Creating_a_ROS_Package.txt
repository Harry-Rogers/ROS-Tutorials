Catkin packages must meet these requirements:
catkin compliant package.xml file provides meta info about package.
CMakeLists.txt which using catkin 
Each package must have its own folder so no packages in same dir.

Structs for above can be found on ros wiki if needed.
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt

Whole dir should look like
Mypackage/
	CMakeLists.txt
	package.xml

catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
makes a beginner tutorials folder containing package.xml and CMakeLists.txt
filled out wtih info ie std_msgs rospy and roscpp

Need to catkin_make again in ws dir

First-order dependencies can be found using rospack depends1 begginer_tutorials
can also see these in the package.xml file.

Indirect dependencies can be found also by using rospack depends1 rospy.
rospy has dependencies like many packages.

calling rospack depends begginer_tutorials shows all dependencies in the dir.

Edited the packages.xml file added name and email and title. Deleted comments
for clarity.
